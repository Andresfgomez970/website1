  <h1>About ROOT</h1>


  <h2> <TAG>Quotations</TAG> </h2>
  <p>
    In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
    Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #eaeaea;">
      <p>
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br>
        --Abraham Lincoln
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </p>




  <p>
    According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://root.cern.ch/">official page</a> ROOT is:
    <blockquote cite="https://root.cern.ch/">
      a modular <em>scientific software toolkit</em>. It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ <strong>but integrated with other languages   </strong> such as Python and R. Start from examples or try it in your browser!
    </blockquote>

  <h2>To begin with</h2>

  <p> To explore ROOT, it must be first understood that it has different functionalities and therefore forms in which it could be use. One simple is in an interactive way, similar to the one of ipython, with the differnce that c++ commands as well as the classes (objects) and functions from ROOT can be used. In addition to that MACROS (special files with root code and c++) can be compiled directly in an interactive way to create a dynamic share library or upload in order to be run in the interface.  Another way to use it is through normal comoilation process in order to create a stand alone application, with some simple options that permits a great ammount of compilation flags and options to be included in the procees of compilation.

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <h3>Rene Brun</h3>

    <p>
      Rene, a lifetime developer of ROOT. He joined CERN in 1973. While working with C. Rubbia at the ISR he developped the HBOOK package still in use today. In 1975 he followed Rubbia in the NA4 deep inelastic muon scattering experiment at the SPS where he was in charge of the simulation and reconstruction software and where GEANT1 and GEANT2 were created. In 1981, he joined OPAL at LEP, creating the GEANT3 detector simulation system, also pioneering the introduction of the first workstations like Apollos in Europe. In 1984 he coordinated the development of the PAW (Physics Analysis Workstation) data analysis system. Until 1994 he was in charge of the Application Software group in the computing division. In 1995, at a time when the majority of software gurus had decided to follow a dead-end line, he created the ROOT system while working for the NA49 heavy ion experiment at the SPS. Rene has led the ROOT project from 1995-2010.

    <h3>Fons Rademakers</h3>

    <p>
      Fons received his Ph.D. in particle physics from the Univ. of Amsterdam in 1991 for his work on event displays and data analysis for the DELPHI experiment at CERN's LEP collider. Since then he has worked at CERN and been involved in designing and developing data analysis programs. In 1991 he joined the PAW project where he developed the column wise-ntuples (a column-oriented storage system) and PIAF, a parallel data analysis system. In 1995, while working as Linux evangelist for Hewlett-Packard at CERN, he started with Rene Brun the ROOT project and has been involved in all aspects of the system since then. In 2001 Fons joined the ALICE collaboration and has worked as software architect on the initial version of the AliRoot framework. In recent years his special attention has gone to high performance parallel computing using PROOF. Fons took over from Rene Brun as ROOT project leader in 2011 and has led the project till 2014, culminating in the release of ROOT 6.
